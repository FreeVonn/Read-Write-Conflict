# Read-write-conflicts-of-shared-variables-in-multi-threaded-parallel-computing

This is a test routine. It is used to describe that the parallel execution of multiple threads containing write operations will lead to write conflict of global variables. It also demonstrates how to use "atomic _<template_>" to avoid such problems.
  
  这是一个测试例程,用来描述多个包含写操作的线程并行执行会导致全局变量的写写冲突,并演示了如何使用"atomic _<template_>"避免此类问题。
